Assignments for N423

(Homework 1)
I recommend using the web4 link. I have a gif that github wouldn't let me upload do to file size restrictions.

Documentation:

There does seem to be a bug where the user will receive a post error when trying to log in. If this occurs you have to create a new account. I haven't determined what the cause of the bug is, but I believe it has something to do with clearing the cache in your browser.

In order to experience the full app follow this path:
Signup > Login > Create a New Dungeon > Select an Existing Dungeon > Enter Room Code > Create Adventurer > Load Adventurer

At this point the user can level up their adventurer, adjust hp and gold, as well as allocate skill points to their stats.
Currently the inventory does not work the way I was wanting. I ran into a structural issue and will not be able to fix it for at least a week.
So with that being said the only delete functionality in this crud app is through the delete character mechanic via the settings page.
